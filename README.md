# CatDog Breed Recommender

This was created with Jarrett Coleman, Tricia Park, Matteo Savarese, and Junlin Yi as the final project for the 2021 Spring semester of CS/INFO 4300: Language and Information at Cornell University.

The purpose of the application (https://catdog-ultimate.herokuapp.com/) is to provide a list of recommended dog or cat breeds based on user preferences and estimated compatibility with pets of the opposite kind.
